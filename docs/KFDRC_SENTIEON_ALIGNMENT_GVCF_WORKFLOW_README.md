The Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC) Sentieon Short Reads Alignment and
Haplotyper Workflow is a Common Workflow Language (CWL) implementation of
various software used to take reads generated by next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies and use those reads to generate alignment and, optionally,
variant information. This workflow mirrors the approach of our existing [BWA-GATK Workflow](./KFDRC_BWA_GATK_ALIGNMENT_GVCF_WORKFLOW_README.md),
and the two have been internally benchmarked as functionally equivalent. The key
difference between the two workflows is found in the tools used during the
alignment process.

This pipeline was made possible thanks to significant software and support
contributions from Sentieon. For more information on our collaborators, check

## Input Files

This workflow has a unique input `sentieon_license` that is not present in our
main alignment workflow. To run the Sentieon tool, users must provide the license
value to run any of the Sentieon tools. We have provided a default value that
works exclusively on CAVATICA. Alternatively, if you wish to use this outside
of CAVATICA, you will need to provide your own server license.

Otherwise, this workflow uses identical inputs as our existing alignment workflow.

## Output Files

This workflow generates outputs identical to our existing alignment workflow.

## Sentieon Alignment: Similarities and Differences

The two workflows start identically; both workflows start by splitting the
input SAMs/BAMs/CRAMs (Alignment/Map files, or AMs) into read group (RG) AMs using samtools split then convert those RG
AMs into FASTQ files using biobambam2 bamtofastq. After FASTQ creation, the
two workflows diverge in software usage. Whereas the KFDRC GATK pipeline uses a
wide variety of tools (bwa, sambamba, samblaster, GATK, Picard, and samtools)
to generate the realigned CRAMs, the KFDRC Sentieon pipeline uses exclusively
software implementations from Sentieon, such as their modified version of
bwa. One notable difference in the flow of the pipeline is where MarkDuplicates
is run. In the original workflow, RG BAMs are split if they are too large.
Duplicate Marking is then run on those individual shards rather than the
complete RG BAMs. In this workflow, however, duplicates are marked over the
whole RG BAM file. Overall this results in a slightly higher rate of marked
duplicates and slightly lower mean coverage. For more information about the
process in the main workflow see https://github.com/kids-first/kf-alignment-workflow#caveats.

Finally, the metrics collection is done with a series of Sentieon algorithms
that match our existing Picard metrics suite.

## Sentieon gVCF Creation: Similarities and Differences

After the creation of a recalibrated BAM, if the user wishes, a gVCF file and
associated metrics are generated. The Sentieon approach is to run Haplotyper on
the recalibrated reads. Like base recalibration, these steps are accomplished
without scattering and therefore no additional merging steps are required.
Metrics collection and contamination estimation are unchanged.

### Workflow Troubleshooting

- Sentieon tools scale up RAM usage to match allocated CPUs. If a task that is
  running into memory issues, that can be solved by EITHER scaling UP the
  task's allocated RAM and scaling DOWN the tasks allocated CPUs.
