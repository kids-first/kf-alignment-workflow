  Kids First Data Resource Center Alignment and Haplotype Calling Workflow (bam/fastq-to-cram, gVCF optional). This pipeline follows
  Broad best practices outlined in [Data pre-processing for variant discovery.](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workflow?id=11165)
  It uses bam/fastq input and aligns/re-aligns to a bwa-indexed reference fasta, version hg38. Resultant bam is de-dupped and
  base score recalibrated. Contamination is calculated and a gVCF is created optionally using GATK4 vbeta.1-3.5 HaplotypeCaller. Inputs from
  this can be used later on for further analysis in joint trio genotyping and subsequent refinement and deNovo variant analysis. If you would like to run this workflow using the cavatica public app, a basic primer on running public apps can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-Cavatica-af5ebb78c38a4f3190e32e67b4ce12bb).
  Alternatively, if you'd like to run it locally using `cwltool`, a basic primer on that can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-CWLtool-b8dbbde2dc7742e4aff290b0a878344d) and combined with app-specific info from the readme below.
  This workflow is the current production workflow, superseding this [public app](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/public/apps#kids-first-drc/kids-first-drc-alignment-workflow/kfdrc-alignment-bam2cram2gvcf/); however the outputs are considered equivalent.

  # Input Agnostic Alignment Workflow
  Workflow for the alignment or realignment of input BAMs, PE reads, and/or SE reads; conditionally generate gVCF and metrics.

  This workflow is a all-in-one workflow for handling any kind of reads inputs: BAM inputs, PE reads
  and mates inputs, SE reads inputs,  or any combination of these. The workflow will naively attempt
  to process these depending on what you tell it you have provided. The user informs the workflow of
  which inputs to process using three boolean inputs: `run_bam_processing`, `run_pe_reads_processing`,
  and `run_se_reads_processing`. Providing `true` values for these as well their corresponding inputs
  will result in those inputs being processed.

  The second half of the workflow deals with optional gVCF creation and metrics collection.
  This workflow is capable of collecting the metrics using the following boolean flags: `run_hs_metrics`,
  `run_wgs_metrics`, and `run_agg_metrics`. To run these metrics, additional optional inputs must
  also be provided: `wxs_bait_interval_list` and `wxs_target_interval_list` for HsMetrics,
  `wgs_coverage_interval_list` for WgsMetrics. To generate the gVCF, set `run_gvcf_processing` to
  `true` and provide the following optional files: `dbsnp_vcf`, `contamination_sites_bed`,
  `contamination_sites_mu`, `contamination_sites_ud`, `wgs_calling_interval_list`, and
  `wgs_evaluation_interval_list`.

  ### Detailed Input Information:
  The pipeline is build to handle three distinct input types:
  1. BAMs
  1. PE Fastqs
  1. SE Fastqs

  Additionally, the workflow supports these three in any combination. You can have PE Fastqs and BAMs,
  PE Fastqs and SE Fastqs, BAMS and PE Fastqs and SE Fastqs, etc. Each of these three classes will be
  procsessed and aligned separately and the resulting BWA aligned bams will be merged into a final BAM
  before performing steps like BQSR and Metrics collection.

  #### BAM Inputs
  The BAM processing portion of the pipeline is the simplest when it comes to inputs. You may provide
  a single BAM or many BAMs. The input for BAMs is a file list. In Cavatica or other GUI interfaces,
  simply select the files you wish to process. For command line interfaces such as cwltool, your input
  should look like the following.
  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "run_pe_reads_processing": false,
    "run_se_reads_processing": false,
    "run_bam_processing": true,
    "input_bam_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/bam1.bam"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/bam2.bam"
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```

  #### SE Fastq Inputs
  SE fastq processing requires more input to build the jobs correctly. Rather than providing a single
  list you must provide two lists: `input_se_reads_list` and `input_se_rgs_list`. The `input_se_reads_list`
  is where you put the files and the `input_se_rgs_list` is where you put your desired BAM @RG headers for
  each reads file. These two lists are must be ordered and of equal length. By ordered, that means the
  first item of the `input_se_rgs_list` will be used when aligning the first item of the `input_se_reads_list`.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: When you are entering the rg names, you need to use a second escape `\` to the tab values `\t`
  as seen below. When the string value is read in by a tool such as cwltool it will interpret a `\\t` input
  as `\t` and a `\t` as the literal `<tab>` value which is not a valid entry for bwa mem.
  If you are using Cavatica GUI, however, no extra escape is necessary. The GUI will add an extra
  escape to any tab values you enter.

  In Cavatica make sure to double check that everything is in the right order when you enter the inputs.
  In command line interfaces such as cwltool, your input should look like the following.
  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "run_pe_reads_processing": false,
    "run_se_reads_processing": true,
    "run_bam_processing": false,
    "input_se_reads_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/single1.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/single2.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "inputs_se_rgs_list": [
      "@RG\\tID:single1\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:single2\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name"
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```
  Take particular note of how the first item in the rgs list is the metadata for the first item in the fastq list.

  #### PE Fastq Inputs
  PE Fastq processing inputs is exactly like SE Fastq processing but requires you to provide the paired mates
  files for your input paired reads. Once again, when using Cavatica make sure your inputs are in the correct
  order. In command line interfaces such as cwltool, your input should look like the following.
  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "run_pe_reads_processing": true,
    "run_se_reads_processing": false,
    "run_bam_processing": false,
    "input_pe_reads_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample1_R1.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample2_R1fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample3_R1.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "input_pe_mates_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample1_R2.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample2_R2.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample3_R2.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "inputs_pe_rgs_list": [
      "@RG\\tID:sample1\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:sample2\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:sample3\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\tSM:sample_name"
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```

  #### Multiple Input Types
  As mentioned above, these three input types can be added in any combination. If you wanted to add
  all three your command line input would look like the following.
  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "run_pe_reads_processing": true,
    "run_se_reads_processing": true,
    "run_bam_processing": true,
    "input_bam_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/bam1.bam"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/bam2.bam"
      }
    ],
    "input_se_reads_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/single1.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/single2.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "inputs_se_rgs_list": [
      "@RG\\tID:single1\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:single2\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name"
    ],
    "input_pe_reads_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample1_R1.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample2_R1fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample3_R1.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "input_pe_mates_list": [
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample1_R2.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample2_R2.fastq"
      },
      {
        "class": "File",
        "location": "/path/to/sample3_R2.fastq"
      }
    ],
    "inputs_pe_rgs_list": [
      "@RG\\tID:sample1\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:sample2\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name",
      "@RG\\tID:sample3\\tLB:library_name\\tPL:ILLUMINA\\tSM:sample_name"
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```

  ### Example Runtimes:
  1. 120 GB WGS BAM with AggMetrics, WgsMetrics, and gVCF creation: 14 hours & $35
  1. 120 GB WGS BAM only: 11 hours
  1. 4x40 GB WGS FASTQ files with AggMetrics, WgsMetrics, and gVCF creation: 23 hours & $72
  1. 4x40 GB WGS FASTQ files only: 18 hours
  1. 4x9 GB WXS FASTQ files with AggMetrics and gVCF creation: 4 hours & $9
  1. 4x9 GB WXS FASTQ files only: 3 hours

  ### Caveats:
  1. Duplicates are flagged in a process that is connected to bwa mem. The implication of this design
     decision is that duplicates are flagged only on the inputs of that are scattered into bwa.
     Duplicates, therefore, are not being flagged at a library level and, for large BAM and FASTQ inputs,
     duplicates are only being detected within a portion of the read group.

  ### Tips for running:
  1. For the fastq input file lists (PE or SE), make sure the lists are properly ordered. The items in
     the arrays are processed based on their position. These lists are dotproduct scattered. This means
     that the first file in `input_pe_reads_list` is run with the first file in `input_pe_mates_list`
     and the first string in `input_pe_rgs_list`. This also means these arrays must be the same
     length or the workflow will fail.
  1. The input for the reference_tar must be a tar file containing the reference fasta along with its indexes.
     The required indexes are `[.64.ann,.64.amb,.64.bwt,.64.pac,.64.sa,.dict,.fai]` and are generated by bwa, picard, and samtools.
     Additionally, an `.64.alt` index is recommended.
  1. If you are making your own bwa indexes make sure to use the `-6` flag to obtain the `.64` version of the
     indexes. Indexes that do not match this naming schema will cause a failure in certain runner ecosystems.
  1. Should you decide to create your own reference indexes and omit the ALT index file from the reference,
     or if its naming structure mismatches the other indexes, then your alignments will be equivalent to the results you would
     obtain if you run BWA-MEM with the -j option.
  1. The following is an example of a complete reference tar input:
  ```
  ~ tar tf Homo_sapiens_assembly38.tgz
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dict
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.alt
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.amb
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.ann
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.bwt
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.pac
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.64.sa
  Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.fai
  ```
  1. For advanced usage, you can skip the knownsite indexing by providing the knownsites_indexes input.
     This file list should contain the indexes for each of the files in your knownsites input. Please
     note this list must be ordered in such a way where the position of the index file in the
     knownsites_indexes list must correspond with the position of the VCF file in the knownsites list
     that it indexes. In the example input below you can see that the 1000G_omni2.5.hg38.vcf.gz.tbi
     file is the fourth item in the knownsites_indexes because the 1000G_omni2.5.hg38.vcf.gz file is the
     fourth item in the knownsites list. Failure to order in this way will result in the pipeline
     failing or generating erroneous files.
  1. Turning off gVCF creation and metrics collection for a minimal successful run.
